first day quiz
 - roughly assess background
 - 3 simple questions, 3 minutes
 - anonymous


lack of textbook
 - detrimental
    - no alternative when lectures make no sense
    - put some texts in library on reserve
 - need supplementary exercises


when first introducing FSMs
 - use different input and output alphabets
    - note that in real life they will be bit arrays
 - don't lead with formal definitions
    - lead from example
    - focus primarily on duality of
        - diagram
        - truth(?)/transition(?) table
    - don't show formalism without first enumerating the components & restrictions of a diagram

## a clever trick

When presenting [implication tables](implication-table.md)
  - states C and F are equivalent
  - prof decides he wants to eliminate F
  - prof: we need to eliminate one.
  - prof: somebody, pick one
This can go 2 ways:
  - either
      - a student: C
      - prof: okay, we keep C
  - or
      - a student: F
      - prof: okay, we eliminate F
