CMOS - complementary metal oxide semiconductor

Built out of NMOS and PMOS MOSFETs.

## Logical Gates
logical gates are designed to have 2 parts
 - pull up
 - pull down

The 2 parts encode complementary functions, so that exactly one of the two is active for any input
 - there is no power consumption when the gate is stable, since 1 is not active
 - there is a logic value, since 1 is active

## Tri-State Buffers

If the design makes both parts inactive, you get the high-impedence state (as in the tri-state buffer)

## D Flip Flop
## Mux
