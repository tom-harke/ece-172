== DIP: dual inline package (?)

 - lead go into holes drilled through the PCB, lined with copper, connected with soldier

== SMT: surface mount technology

 - sits on surface of board, unlike DIP.
 - "gull wing" leads connect to board
 - [PCB](_acronyms.md) has bars/pads on which the leads sit

== SMD: surface mount device
== SOIC: small outline inter.....ted circuit
== SOP: small outline package
== PLCC: plastic leaded chip carrier
   It is J-leaded where leads bend in, under package (opposite of gull wing)
== PGA (BGA): pin (ball) grid array

  - PGA vs BGA: long pins vs stubby solder balls on pad
  - pins are desribed via coordinates
    - letters for rows (except I and O which are easy to misread as 1 and 0)
    - numbers for columns
  - use "reflow soldering" to attach, by baking in an overn
